<p>Have you ever heard of the Akbar - Birbal story "Whatever happens, happens for good" ?? If not This how it goes.</p>

<p>Once on a fine morning, Akbar decided to go to hunting along with Birbal. While he was handling his sword he accidentally hurt his little finger, seeing this Birbal gave a smile and said "Everything happens for the best”. This time Akbar was really upset and ordered for Birbal to be put in prison. Akbar asked Birbal, “Now, what do you think?” The Birbal again replied, “Everything happens for the best”. </p>

<p>The next day with his bandaged finger Akbar went to the forest for hunting with his soldiers. Unfortunately, he was separated from his soldiers and was trapped by tribals who lives there. That day the tribals had some tradition to sacrifice a human to their god. While they were about to sacrifice Akbar, they saw that he was hurt and was not a perfect specimen for the sacrifice, so they released him.</p>

<p>On his return, he got to know that  Birbal was right and thanked god for hurting his finger. He directly went to Birbal and asked for an apology and told him that he was right.He also asked that how was his imprisonment good for him.  </p>

<p>Birbal replied that if he was not imprisoned, he would be taken to the forest and when Akbar was rejected by the tribals he would have been sacrificed to the tribal's god in place of Akbar.</p>

<p>After reading this story, the phrase  "Whatever happens happens for the best!!" stuck in my mind for a very long time. When I  started analyzing how this phrase suited me,  I got to know that it's true!! . It is true.  I started believing that everything happens for a reason and the only thing I should do is, to do it to the best I can. </p>

<p>It is true that everything in life happens for a reason. Because all our past experiences actually happened to bring us to where we are today and it is always for our good. Our past experiences make us a better person. So, whatever difficulties that we face today, takes us to the next level.Whenever you couldn't  get an opportunity it means that something more or great opportunity is waiting for you. The only thing you should do is to try and try, till you get that opportunity. So start believing in yourself and do it!!</p>

<p>Whatever happens, happens for the best!!</p>

<p>Do your level best!!!</p>

<p>All the best!!</p>
