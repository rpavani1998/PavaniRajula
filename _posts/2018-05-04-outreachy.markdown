<p>Frankly, I never imagined myself blogging. But here I am starting my own blog as a part of my Internship. Earlier I have no much opinion on blogging but when I started exploring about Outreachy, I went through a lot of blogs which answered a lot of questions regarding opting an organization, choosing the right project, making a strong proposal and getting selected. This made me understand the puropse of doing it.</p>

<h1> Outreachy</h1>

<p>If you have heard and read about people discussing about open source projects, but never knew what to do or how to begin.Open source programs like Gsoc, RGsoc, Outreachy provides a good platform where you can place your first steps to enter this new world. The mentors and others in the project are patient enough and very supportive to clear the doubts you post in the forums. Unlike Gsoc this is only for Girls.</p>

<h2>How I got to know about this?</h2>
<p>I got to know about the Outreachy Program from my brother. I had this urge to do something challenging, which involves learning new stuff. So I reached out to my brother, who is a GSoC 2017 student. From him, I learned about Outreachy and when the applications opened for Summer 2018, he urged me to apply for it and so I did.</p>

<h2>Most challenging part of the application process</h2>
<p>The applications for the Outreachy Program expect aspiring interns to make a small contribution to a relevant open source project as an eligibility criteria. The most challenging part of my application process was that I had to pick an organization and a project to work on. I was inexperienced and didn’t know what to pick. I simply choose a project that has technologies I know, description I understood and I felt I could do it.</p>

<h2>During the application process</h2>
<p>I emailed my mentors, got myself assigned to some tasks to be done and was asked to make any small contribution to the project I was working on. From then on, I kept in touch with my mentors through e-mail and completed the task and made a contribution with their help. I feel like my goal at that point was to do more than just the bare minimum of submitting a single patch to become eligible. I felt even though if I don’t get accepted, all the effort I was putting into learning to contribute to Ceph was going to be worth it. I really took a very long time in understanding the project and struggled a lot making things work. But that happiness when you do that task after such a immense struggle is nothing.</p>

<h2>Accepted!!</h2>
<p>When I think back to that day, I remember how important it was to me that I get accepted as an Outreachy Intern. It was surreal to see my name as one of the interns for Outreachy. I was just relieved and happy. I am very excited to meet the people behind these projects. I am a bit anxious too.</p>

<p>Before I end my post here, I’d also like to extend my thanks to the organizers of the Outreachy Program, the Outreachy coordinators at Ceph and my brother who was after me for this to happen. Thank you!</p>
